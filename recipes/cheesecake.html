    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This New York cheesecake is dense and rich. It includes a great technique for letting the cheesecake finish in the oven so that no cracks form as the cake cools.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>18 Crushed Graham Crackers</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons Melted Butter</li>
        <li>1 Cup Sour Cream</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Flour</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Cups White Sugar</li>
        <li>32 Ounces Cream Cheese</li>
        <li>2/3 Cup Milk</li>
        <li>4 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Lemon Zest</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Orange Zest</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
        <li>Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl</li>
        <li>Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined.
             Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. 
             Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. 
             Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
      </ol>
